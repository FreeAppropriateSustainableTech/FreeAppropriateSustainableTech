- 👋 Hi, I’m @FreeAppropriateSustainableTech
-  The Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST) research group run by Professor Joshua Pearce as Western University in Canada.
-  👀 We are interested in exploring the way solar photovoltaic technology can sustainably power our society and how open-source hardware like open source appropriate technologies (or OSAT) and RepRap 3-D printing can drive distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) (and maybe even social change).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to make more sustainable tech easier for people to access.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source hardware
